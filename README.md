## Work in Progress: DevEnv Sync Extension

**DevEnv Sync** is a VSCode/Cursor extension (VSIX) that will let you:

- Log in to your account (GitHub or email/password)
- Create named backups of your IDE settings and extensions, with descriptions
- Upload backups to your cloud profile (with overwrite/rename prompts)
- View and manage all your profiles directly in the extension
- Restore or merge profiles to your IDE:
  - **Add to IDE:** Merge profileâ€™s settings/extensions with your current setup
  - **Switch to Profile:** Replace all current settings/extensions with a profile (with warning/confirmation)
- (Planned) Browse and import public profiles from a community marketplace
- (Planned) Premium features: profile limits, switching, team sharing, and more
